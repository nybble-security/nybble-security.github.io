# Bring your Own SIEM
You have a SIEM which centralizes all your logs, trigger some alerts, but no processing is done ?  
You can connect your SIEM to Nybble Hub and let our community do the job for you.

## How does it work ?
Your SIEM is sending alert payloads to Nybble Hub. A connector must be declared on Hub side, then configured as a target in your SIEM (usually with webhooks).  
Analysts from Nybble requires an access to your SIEM, to do investigations. We're providing you all the details in dedicated pages per vendor.
