# Nybble Registration Process
<center>![Registration Process](../img/registration-process.png){style="width:70%;"}</center>
Bringing the best blue team community requires a good registration process.  
Our process consists of several steps, designed to ensure clarity for everyone involved, quality of community members and respect of international laws.

## Administrative side

Working with freelancers or companies requires some verifications and informations:

- Personal Informations: required to check your identity, as part of the KYB (Know Your Business) process. No business is possible without verified identity
- Company Informations: required to make invoices and identify which companies Nybble is involved with
- Experience Informations: more about your professional skills. It will be combined with tests to determine if you can become a community member.    

Without all these informations, you cannot complete the registration and gain your Nybble account.

## Tests : Dojo

At Nybble, we trust tests more than references. That's why we've designed the Dojo platform.  

Some rules and tips:

- You can complete one or more tests (at least one is required to become a Nybbler)
- Each test provides you the according profile (named "license") in the Nybble Hub.
- You can come back and do another test (to grab a new license) after your registration : in case of success, your Nybble Hub profile will be upgraded
- Each try of a test is reviewed by Nybble team and can finish in 3 ways:
    - Validated (hooray)
    - Failed, and a retry is given with no delay
    - Failed, with a delay. Usually given when some practice is required before retrying

2 tests are available in the Dojo:

- Become an analyst: a real-life alert triage. We will check your answers and comments.
- Become a hunter: a fictive campaign with threats to find and report.
