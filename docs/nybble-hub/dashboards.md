Nybble displays 4 metrics, declined per security level:

- Received alerts: all alerts sent by the SIEM, no matter the status. The security level helps you to see the criticality of alerts thrown by your SI.
- Under investigation: Nybble is currently working on these alerts, or is waiting for client inputs.
- Investigated: Closed alerts, covered by an investigation. 
- False positive: closed alerts by dismissing them. Nybble is constantly working to reduce this number.
